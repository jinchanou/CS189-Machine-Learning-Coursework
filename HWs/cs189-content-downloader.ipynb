It fetches **only the folder you ask for** from the public course repo and puts it under `cs189/<repo>/<folder_to_fetch>`.\n","\n","## Where files go\n","- **Colab**: `/content/drive/MyDrive/cs189/<folder_to_fetch>`\n","- **Local**: `./cs189/<folder_to_fetch>`\n","\n","## How to use\n","1) Make a copy of this notebook!\n","2) Run the cells below to set up the content downloader\n","3) Define the folder you want to fetch (`folder_to_fetch`) from the public course repo and the location in *your* Google Drive you want to download the files to (`gdrive_base_folder`)\n","  > Ex: `folder_to_fetch` can be `\"hw/hw1\"` or `\"lec/lec02\"`\n","  >\n","  > Ex: `gdrive_base_folder` can be `\"school/cs189\"`. Then, the content from the public course repo will be downloaded to a nested folder in your Google Drive home.\n","\n","4) Call the function `fetch_repo_folder` with the arguments.\n","  > Note: you can also use this notebook to fetch newly-updated content from the public course repo. If the `folder_to_fetch` already exists in your Google Drive, the `fetch_repo_folder` function will first make a copy of the existing folder inside your Google Drive's `gdrive_base_folder` as a backup.\n","5) You should see a new folder in your Google Drive named whatever you set `gdrive_base_folder` to be. This folder will contain a `.repo` folder as well as any folders you fetched with the `fetch_repo_folder` function!\n","  > For context, the `.repo` folder is a barebones clone of the public course repo that contains all information needed to fetch the latest materials without actually copying the entire repo over. This way, you can download specific folders one-by-one without having to take up space in your drive by copying the whole public repo!\n","\n","### Example (homework 1)\n","```python\n","folder = \"hw/hw1\"\n","path = fetch_repo_folder(folder)  # -> /.../cs189/fa25-student/hw/hw1\n","print(\"Ready at:\", path)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RGo-ejhmaqqM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762919037122,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":5974,"user":{"displayName":"Terry Kim","userId":"03457895093288389637"}},"outputId":"56f3c45a-d9bc-47de-eacd-37e3b43127ea"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["This is a Google Colab notebook.\n","Git LFS initialized.\n"]}],"source":["#@title Check for git LFS\n","import os\n","if \"google.colab\" in str(get_ipython()):\n","    from google.colab import drive\n","    print(\"This is a Google Colab notebook.\")\n","    !apt-get install -qq git-lfs\n","    !git lfs install\n","else:\n","  import shutil\n","  if shutil.which(\"git-lfs\") is None:\n","      print(\"⚠️ Git LFS is not installed.
